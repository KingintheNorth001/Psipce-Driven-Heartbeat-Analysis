**Project Overview**

The project aims to create a functioning and accurate Heart Signal Analysis 
Circuit through software-based simulation, using Pspice, and find the BPM of 
patients from ECG data. Subsequent amplification, integration, multiplication, 
and filtering techniques are applied to obtain a digital signal from which the Pulse 
Rate is extracted. The heart Rate Monitor Circuit is a crucial component in 
biomedical instrumentation and health tracking systems. 

**Features**

Amplification of weak bio-signals (heartbeat pulses)

Removal of low-frequency baseline drift (below 0.5 Hz)

Filtering of high-frequency noise (above 50 Hz)

Visualization of the processed signal

Simulation using PSpice or Proteus

Circuit Design Stages

Signal Acquisition: Simulated electrodes detect heartbeat signals.

Instrumentation Amplifier: Provides high common-mode rejection.

High-Pass Filter: Removes baseline wander (cutoff ~0.5 Hz).

Low-Pass Filter: Filters out high-frequency noise (cutoff ~50 Hz).

**Real-Life Applications**

HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY: Heart rate monitor circuits are crucial in medical equipment 
like ECG machines, helping doctors monitor and diagnose cardiovascular 
conditions more effectively.  
FITNESS INDUSTRY: Portable heart rate monitors integrated into smartwatches or 
fitness bands allow athletes and fitness enthusiasts to optimize their workouts 
based on real-time heart rate data.  
RESEARCH: In academic and R&D settings, heart rate monitor circuits can be used 
in studies examining human physiology, stress, and the effects of various 
interventions on cardiac health.  
PERSONAL USE: DIY heart rate monitor kits and readily 
available devices enable individuals to track their 
heart rate for personal wellness, potentially alerting 
them to irregularities that may require medical 
attention. 


Output Stage: Displays the cleaned signal on an oscilloscope.
